# Multiplayer Pong

A two-players online (or single player offline) Pong, created to test the multiplayer networking features in CraftStudio since its my first ever multiplayer game.

The project is really basic, I just took the code from Blast Turtle and adapted it to my style and the needs of a game like Pong.

## How to play

Once the game is open, you can click on the "host" text to become the server.

The other player must then fill your public IP adresse in the field then click "Join".

You can run the game twice on the same computer, just let the 127.0.0.1 IP when joining.
