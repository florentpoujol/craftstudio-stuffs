# CraftStudio Script Handler

This app can convert [CraftStudio](http://craftstud.io)'s Script assets (.csscript) to regular Lua scripts (`.lua`) and vice-versa.

The app can read a CraftStudio project and create a `.lua` version of all of the project's scripts.  
It can also read `.lua` scripts and write the corresponding Script asset in a CraftStudio project.

The script's public properties may be modified from the `.lua` version.

## Download

Check the `build` folder.

## How to use

You can set several "CraftStudio project" and "Lua project", identified by a path and name.

Select a CraftStudio project and a Lua project then click one of the buttons to begin the conversion.

Be advised of the following limitations :

- Your local CraftStudio server has to be stopped to read from or write to a CraftStudio project.
- The app only reads and writes the current version of the Script assets (the "Current" revision).
- The app never creates, moves or deletes scripts in the CraftStudio project so it only writes a Script asset from a `.lua` script when the path, or name matche.
- When writing `.lua` scripts, the app does not deletes or moves existing scripts, it just creates missing scripts or overwrite existing ones.
- Indentations in the `.lua` scripts must use (4) spaces, not tabs.


## Public properties

The asset's public properties (if any) are found at the top of the `.lua` scripts and follow this pattern :

    --[[PublicProperties
    name type defaultValue
    /PublicProperties]]

- The name, type and defaultValue must be separated by at least one space and must exist on the same line.
- The type may be `boolean`, `number` or `string`.
- When the property is of type `string`, its value must be enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`).
- You may delete, move or modify any existing properties or add new properties.

Ie :

    --[[PublicProperties
    isAlive boolean true
    health  number  52.8
    name string "John"
    /PublicProperties]]
